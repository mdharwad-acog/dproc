## Key Insights

Here are 3 key insights based on the dataset statistics:

-   **High Uniqueness Across Key Identifiers**: All records exhibit unique values for `name`, `age`, and `city`, indicating that each of the 4 records represents a distinct individual, age, and geographical location within this sample.
-   **Predominantly Active Entities**: A significant majority (75%, or 3 out of 4) of the records are marked as 'true' in the `active` field, suggesting a strong bias towards active users or entities within this dataset.
-   **Potential Data Type Considerations**: Numerical data (like `age`) and boolean data (like `active`) are stored as strings (e.g., "30", "true"), which would require type conversion for numerical operations or proper boolean logic in data processing or analysis.
